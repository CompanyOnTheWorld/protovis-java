PROTOVIS-BENCHMARKS README

This project contains the benchmarks described in the research paper:
http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/protovis-design

The code maps to paper sections as follows:

pv.benchmark.update    -> Section 5.1.3
pv.benchmark.lazy      -> Section 5.1.4
pv.benchmark.render    -> Section 5.2
pv.benchmark.animation -> Section 5.3
pv.benchmark.graph     -> Section 5.4

Some benchmark classes may require configuration of values or multiple runs
to exactly replicate the benchmarks described in the paper.

The project requires that the protovis project and dependent libraries be
available on the classpath or system library path.
